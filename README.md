# Error Cleaning 

## Abstract
This paper covers multiple scenarios where errors could happen when taking measurements or cleaning the data. We stimulate this by generating a set using normal distribution and seeing what would happen if: the measurement was wrong, the numbers got changed during the process by being turned into positives or turned into decimals. We also look at the mean for each of these scenarios and graph the normal distribution better to compare them. We see that all the cleaning procedures do give us a better mean but not a better normal distribution compared to the raw/cleaned data. 


## LLM Usage: 
Chatgpt was used as our generative ai to help with definitions, error codes and exceptional cases in our code when, the textbook provided or the internet didn't provide answers.
